# About Myself And My Life!

### My Description
Hi! I my name is Ryan. I'm a Lua, Python and Javascript developer. I honestly love developing things. Its really awesome to see the things i can make using my Talent! 

### My Life
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever since i was 11, I always wanted to make my own game. But i didn't know how to do it whatsoever. So i did what every beginner would do. Search in YouTube! I quickly understood that if i want to make games and communicate with my devices then i would have to learn programming. Programming is honestly a group of languages such as: Javascript, Lua, Python and so much more! After practicing everyday for 2 years i eventually learned most of the coding languages. But i mastered lua the fastest and it's my favorite language. And now here i am. If i never had the idea to make a game and not seached that up on YouTube. I don't think i would be here. So yeah thats it!
